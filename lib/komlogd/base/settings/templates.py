#    command: df -k    # it can be a command, a script, etc
#    schedule:         # crontab style schedule

# Create an entry for each python file with transfer methdos you want to load. The following is an example:

#- transfers:
#   enabled: yes
#   filename: /home/komlog/.komlogd/transfers/transfer_methods.py 

# In the previous example, we can indicate the filename with a relative path too from the application directory.
# Application directory is the one where the configuration file is located.
#So, for example, if application directory is /home/komlog/.komlogd, we can indicate the previous file with:
# filename: transfers/transfer_methods.py
